Subject: Your Updated Performance Report & New Portal Access

Hi Ray,

I’ve just updated your monthly report with a brand new **SEO & On-Page Performance** section to show the impact of our technical optimizations.

You can access the full interactive report here:
👉 **[Login to Client Portal](http://clients.741-studio.com/)**

**Your Login Details:**
*   **Username:** Reload Sanctuary
*   **Password:** (The one we set up previously - let me know if you need a reset!)

**What’s New in the Report:**
*   **SEO Data Table:** A clear breakdown of Technical (+63%), Overall Health (+28%), and Optimization Score (87% - Excellent).
*   **Visual Proof:** Clickable screenshots of the audit data (just click to enlarge).
*   **Optimization Roadmap:** Focused sprints for Content Expansion and Local Authority.

I am also recording a **video walkthrough** to explain these numbers in detail and run through the next steps. I’ll send that over shortly so you and the team can watch it at your convenience.

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime!

Best,
Martin
