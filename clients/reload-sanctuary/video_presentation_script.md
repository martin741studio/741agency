# Video Presentation Script: Reload Sanctuary (Feb 2026 Report)

**Goal:** Walk the client through the February performance, highlight the "wins," explain the strategy behind the numbers, and get approval for the next optimization phase.

---

## 1. The Executive Summary (The "Hook")
*   **Opening:** "Hi [Client Name], Martin here. I wanted to walk you through the February performance report because we’ve hit some really interesting milestones this month."
*   **The Headline:** "In short: We are seeing **massive volume** and **incredible efficiency**. We generated over **2,100 clicks** and **400+ conversions** this month."
*   **The Key Stat:** "Our Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) is sitting at just **16k IDR**. For context, anything under 50k in this industry is good. 16k is exceptional. It means we are acquiring leads/bookings for the price of a coffee."

## 2. Reviewing the Data (The "Evidence")
*(Scroll to Campaign Breakdown Table)*

*   **The Workhorse (Gym / Classes):**
    *   "Look at the 'Search – Gym / Classes' campaign. This is our engine. It drove over **1,000 clicks** and **221 conversions** alone. This proves there is consistent, high-intent demand for your core fitness offerings."
*   **The Surprise Performer (PMAX):**
    *   "Performance Max (PMAX) is also punching way above its weight. It's bringing in volume at a very low cost (CPA around 6k IDR). This tells us that your brand visuals and broader reach assets are working well."
*   **The Premium Segment (Wellness):**
    *   "Recover & Wellness is lower volume but high value. We're seeing decent efficiency here, but I believe we can get more out of it."

## 3. The "Hidden" Opportunity (Important Insight)
*(Scroll to 'Top Segments' and 'Keyword Drivers')*

*   **Mobile Dominance:** "93% of your traffic is on Mobile. This is huge. It means your Instagram integration and mobile booking flow are critical. We are winning because we are capturing people 'on the go' in Bali."
*   **The "Ice Bath" Spike:**
    *   "Here is the most exciting insight from the data: Look at the CTR (Click-Through-Rate) for terms like **'Ice bath'** and **'Cold Plunge'**.
    *   We are seeing CTRs of **12%, 17%, even 100%** on some specific terms.
    *   **Translation:** People are desperate for recovery in Canggu, and when they see your ad, they click. This is an untapped goldmine."
*   **HYROX Interest:** "We're also seeing strong engagement (9.26% CTR) on HYROX and Functional training terms. This is a niche we clearly own."

## 4. The Strategy: What We Should Do Next
*(Scroll to 'Optimization Roadmap')*

*   "So, what does this mean for March? We are shifting from 'Setup' to 'Scale & Optimize'."

### A. Immediate Optimizations (The "Must-Dos")
1.  **Scale Recovery:** "Because the 'Ice Bath/Sauna' intent is so high, I want to create a **dedicated 'Sauna & Plunge' ad group**. Right now, it's mixed in. By separating it, we can write ads that specifically say 'Best Ice Bath in Canggu' and capture 100% of that intent."
2.  **Verification:** "We will complete the Advertiser Verification. this adds a blue shield to your ads and improves trust CTR."
3.  **Visuals:** "We will add more image extensions to the Search ads. Since 93% are on mobile, taking up more screen real estate with images will push competitors down."

### B. Growth Strategy (The "Vision")
*   "We are going to be aggressive on the **Recovery** aspect. The data says this is the easiest win for new revenue."
*   "We will keep the Gym campaign running as is—it's a machine. Don't fix what isn't broken."

## 5. Summary & Call to Action
*   "Overall, the account is healthy and profitable. We are getting leads cheap, and volume is high."
*   "I'm going to implement these changes (Sauna ad group, Verification) this week."
*   "Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to push harder on any specific area. Talk soon!"
