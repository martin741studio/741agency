# Instructions for Ray: Campaign Execution

Hi Ray, here is the process for handling new and active campaigns for Reload Sanctuary.

## 1. Where to Look
*   **Source of Truth:** checking `campaign_tracker.md` in this folder.
*   Look under the **"New Campaign Request"** section for new tasks.

## 2. Your Process
1.  **Check for Requests:** If you see a filled-out request in `campaign_tracker.md`, review the details (Topic, Budget, Creative).
2.  **Clarify (if needed):** If any assets or details are missing, ask immediately.
3.  **Execute:** Set up the campaign in Meta Ads Manager or Google Ads based on the inputs.
4.  **Update Status:**
    *   Move the details from "New Campaign Request" to the **"Active Campaigns"** table.
    *   Set status to `Active` or `In Review`.
    *   Clear the request inputs from the request section so it's ready for the next one.

## 3. Reporting
*   Keep the **Active Campaigns** table updated weekly with key metrics (ROAS, CPA, or simply "On Track").
*   If a campaign is underperforming, mark it in the Notes column.

Let's keep this organized to ensure we execute fast on new topics!
