# Walkthrough: Reload Sanctuary Service-Focused Invoice (v4)

I have successfully generated the **Service-Focused (v4)** invoice deliverables for **Reload Sanctuary**. This version is optimized for service-based billing with no physical product references and includes a CSV export for Google Sheets.

## Accomplishments
- **Service-Based Layout:** Removed "Ship to" and product terminology. Updated labels to "Service" and "Rate".
- **Text-Based Branding:** Removed the square logo and updated the primary branding to `741.Studio` (with dot) in a large, bold font.
- **Clean Footer:** Stripped the contact info down to just the Website, Email, and Bank details for a minimalist professional feel.
- **Dual Deliverables:** Generated both a high-fidelity **PDF** and a structured **CSV** file for easy uploading to Google Sheets.
- **Desktop Delivery:** Both files are saved directly to your Desktop for immediate access.

## Deliverables
- **PDF Invoice (v4):** [Reload_Sanctuary_Invoice_V4_Service.pdf](file:///Users/martindrendel/Desktop/Reload_Sanctuary_Invoice_V4_Service.pdf)
- **CSV Data (v4):** [Reload_Sanctuary_Invoice_V4_Service.csv](file:///Users/martindrendel/Desktop/Reload_Sanctuary_Invoice_V4_Service.csv)
- **Generator v4:** [invoice_gen.py](file:///Users/martindrendel/741agency/tools/invoice_gen.py) (Updated for service-focused PDF and CSV export).

## Verification
- **Visual Check:** Confirmed `741.Studio` branding and cleanup of the "Ship to" and square logo areas.
- **Export Check:** Verified that the CSV contains all service line items and accurate totals for easy Sheets integration.
- **Math Integrity:** Subtotal (Rp20.000.000), withholding tax (-Rp400.000), and grand total (Rp19.600.000) are all correct.
