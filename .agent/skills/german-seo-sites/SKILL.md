# German SEO-Site Link Utilization (Controlled & Safe)

## Skill Purpose

Enable the AI to use SEO-type sites (Web 2.0, blogs, aggregators, bookmarking, PDFs, etc.) in a controlled, German-language context, strictly as supporting infrastructure, while minimizing footprint, anchor risk, and long-term penalties.

This skill does not replace business databases — it supports and amplifies them.

---

## Positioning Rule (Very Important)

**SEO sites are never the foundation.**
They are:
- **Tier 2** (support)
- **Tier 3** (indexing & noise)

If business databases = skeleton,
SEO sites = connective tissue.

---

## Inputs
- Target niche (variable)
- Target city / region (Germany first)
- Target pages (homepage + selected inner pages)
- Current anchor distribution
- Publishing velocity limits

---

## Outputs
- Approved SEO-site targets (Germany-prioritized)
- Anchor assignment per placement
- Content template per placement
- Tier assignment (2 or 3)
- Link destination (money page vs support asset)

---

## 1️⃣ SEO Site Categories (Germany-First)

### A. German Web 2.0 Platforms (Tier 2)

Used for contextual reinforcement, not raw power.

**Allowed platforms:**
- WordPress.com (DE content)
- Medium (German posts)
- Jimdo (German setup)
- Google Sites (German)
- Notion (German hubs)
- Tumblr (German, informational tone)

**Rules:**
- German language only
- One target page per asset
- Max 1 link to money page
- Must include:
    - 1 German authority link (Wikipedia DE, IHK, BG, DIN, etc.)
    - 1 neutral resource link

### B. SEO Blogs / Article Directories (Tier 2 → Tier 3)

These are classic SEO sites, but filtered.

**Approval rules:**
- German language
- Some editorial structure
- Visible categories
- Not pure link dumps

**Usage:**
- Mostly brand or URL anchors
- Prefer linking to:
    - Web 2.0
    - PDFs
    - Google Sites
    - Rarely directly to money pages

### C. PDFs / Document Hosts (Tier 2)

High value when done right.

**Allowed:**
- Issuu
- Scribd
- PubHTML5
- DocDroid
- 4shared (with restraint)

**Rules:**
- 800–1,200 words
- Informational tone
- Structured headings
- 1 link max to main site
- German language

### D. Social Bookmarking (Tier 3)

**Purpose:**
- Indexing
- Crawl frequency
- Velocity smoothing

**Rules:**
- Never exact-match anchors
- Prefer URLs or brand
- Targets:
    - Web 2.0
    - PDFs
    - Blog posts
    - Not money pages directly

---

## 2️⃣ Anchor Strategy (Stricter than usual)

Because SEO sites are risky, anchor discipline is tighter.

**Allowed Anchor Mix on SEO Sites:**
- 50–60% Brand
- 25–35% Naked URL
- 10–15% Generic
- 0–5% Partial match
- ❌ **0% Exact match (hard rule)**

**Agent hard-stop:**
If anchor quota exceeded → block publication.

---

## 3️⃣ German Context Enforcement

The agent must ensure:
- German language content
- German spelling (DE, not AT/CH mix unless intended)
- References to:
    - city / region
    - industry context
- No translated spam

**Rejection triggers:**
- Auto-translated text
- Mixed-language paragraphs
- Overly promotional phrasing

---

## 4️⃣ Tier Logic (Critical for Safety)

### Tier 2 (Selective)
- High-quality Web 2.0
- PDFs
- Strong German SEO blogs

**Targets:**
- Inner pages
- Brand homepage (limited)

### Tier 3 (High volume, low risk)
- Social bookmarks
- Aggregators
- Indexing hubs

**Targets:**
- Tier 2 assets only
- **Never money pages**

---

## 5️⃣ Velocity & Pattern Control

**Publishing rhythm (example):**
- Week 1–2: 3–5 SEO assets
- Week 3–4: 5–8 SEO assets
- Gradual increase only if:
    - Business database links already live
    - Anchors are diluted

**Agent rule:**
SEO-site links should never outnumber business-database links.

---

## 6️⃣ Quality Scoring for SEO Sites

**Approve if:**
- German language
- Some editorial layout
- Indexed pages
- No obvious “sell links” signals

**Reject if:**
- Spun content farms
- Hundreds of outbound links
- Repetitive anchor usage
- Same IP / obvious network clusters

---

## 7️⃣ How This Skill Integrates with the Other Two

**Skill 1 – Business Database Scraping**
→ builds trust & relevance

**Skill 2 – Qualification & Publishing Plan**
→ enforces anchor + pacing discipline

**Skill 3 – SEO-Site Utilization**
→ provides support, indexing, velocity

**Together:**
Entity → Authority → Reinforcement

---

## One-Line Skill Definition

This AI safely utilizes German-language SEO sites as Tier 2 and Tier 3 support by enforcing strict anchor control, German context, tiered linking, and velocity limits to strengthen overall rankings without long-term risk.

---

## Reality Check (Honest)
- SEO sites still work
- They just don’t work alone
- When controlled, they:
    - speed up indexing
    - stabilize rankings
    - support local dominance

Used wrongly → penalty
Used like this → quiet advantage
