# AI Skill: Modular Agency Proposal, Scope & Cost System

## Skill Purpose

Enable the AI to create structured, professional proposals that include:
*   Core project delivery (design & development)
*   Optional growth modules (SEO, Ads)
*   Clear scope, hours, pricing
*   Flexible tone depending on partner vs direct client

---

## 1. Core Project Scope (Base Module)

(unchanged – design, development, revisions, launch)

### Rule:
Core scope is always listed first, add-ons come after, clearly separated.

---

## 2. Optional Module: SEO (On-Page & Off-Page)

### When AI should suggest SEO
*   Website relaunch or new website
*   Local businesses
*   Long-term visibility goals
*   Existing traffic but poor rankings

### AI phrasing rule:
"Optional but highly recommended for visibility and long-term traffic."

### A. SEO On-Page (Optional)

**Scope includes:**
*   Keyword research (service + intent-based)
*   Page structure & heading optimization
*   Meta titles & descriptions
*   Internal linking structure
*   Technical basics (indexing, speed, mobile)

**Estimated effort:**
*   Setup & core pages: 8–12 hours
*   Larger sites: scalable by page count

**Pricing logic:**
*   Hourly (55 € / USD) or
*   Fixed package (preferred for clarity)

**Example output:**
*   Estimated effort: 10–14 hours
*   Estimated cost: 550 – 770 €

### B. SEO Off-Page (Optional)

**Scope includes:**
*   Backlink strategy planning
*   Local citations / directories (if relevant)
*   Outreach or link placements
*   Authority building over time

**Important AI rule:**
*   Never promise rankings
*   Always frame as long-term signal building

**Pricing logic:**
*   Monthly retainer preferred
*   Clear deliverables per month

**Example:**
*   Monthly SEO Off-Page: 300 – 600 € / month

---

## 3. Optional Module: Paid Advertising

AI must split strategy, setup, and management clearly.

### A. Paid Ads Strategy & Setup (Meta or Google)

**Scope includes:**
*   Account structure & conversion tracking
*   Audience or keyword research
*   Campaign & ad group setup
*   Initial creatives / ad copy
*   Pixel / tag integration

**Estimated effort:**
*   6–10 hours

**Pricing example:**
*   Setup fee: 330 – 550 €

### Rule:
Setup is one-time, management is recurring.

### B. Ongoing Paid Ads Management (Monthly)

**Scope includes:**
*   Campaign optimization
*   Budget allocation
*   A/B testing
*   Reporting & insights
*   Creative iteration (light)

**Pricing logic (AI chooses based on budget):**
*   Flat monthly fee or
*   Percentage of ad spend (if high budget)

**Example:**
*   Monthly management: 400 – 800 € / month
*   Ad spend handled separately

### AI phrasing rule:
"Ad budget is paid directly by the client to the platform and is not included in management fees."

---

## 4. Proposal Assembly Logic (How the AI puts it together)

AI must:
1.  Present Base Project
2.  Add Optional Growth Modules
3.  Clearly mark each as:
    *   Included
    *   Optional
    *   Monthly / One-time
4.  Summarize totals without pressure

---

## 5. Cost Summary Structure (Final Section)

AI outputs a clean summary like:

**Cost Overview**
*   Website Design & Development: X €
*   SEO On-Page (optional): X €
*   SEO Off-Page (optional): X € / month
*   Paid Ads Setup (optional): X €
*   Paid Ads Management (optional): X € / month

### Rule:
Optional ≠ hidden. Everything visible, nothing forced.

---

## 6. Tone & Trust Rules (Critical)

The AI must:
*   Avoid hype (“guaranteed results”)
*   Avoid fear-selling
*   Emphasize collaboration
*   Sound like a senior consultant, not a salesperson

**Example phrasing:**
"These modules can be added at any point and are structured to scale depending on priorities and budget."

---

## One-Line Skill Definition (Final)

This AI creates modular, client-ready agency proposals by combining core delivery with optional SEO and paid advertising modules, clearly defining scope, hours, pricing, and responsibilities in a professional, trust-based tone.
