# [Gioia Cheese] Website Proposal: WordPress Edition

**Executive Summary:**
A fully custom, owner-controlled cheese shop built on **WordPress + WooCommerce**. This option offers maximum flexibility and avoids Shopify's monthly platform fees, but requires slightly more setup to match the "seamless" checkout experience.

**Proposed Scope (WordPress/WooCommerce):**

| Component | Est. Hours | Deliverables / Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Design & Strategy** | **10 hrs** | Same "clean but fun" Graza-inspired design process. |
| **💻 Dev & Integration** | **34 hrs** | Setup of WP Engine, building custom layouts for 8 pages. <br>*Extra time required for custom Checkout styling & Account pages.* |
| **🛒 Store Configuration** | **12 hrs** | WooCommerce setup, payment gateways (Stripe/Xendit), shipping calculators, and transactional email design. |

**Investment Breakdown:**
*   **Total Project Hours:** 56 hours
*   **Applied Rate:** $55 / hour (Partner Rate)
*   **Total Launch Investment:** **$3,080**

**Optional Add-on:**
*   **Basic SEO Setup:** +$770 (Keywords + Google Maps Setup).

**Ongoing Costs (Client Direct):**
*   **Hosting:** ~$15 - $25/month (High-performance Cloud Hosting).
*   **Licenses:** ~$10/month (Estimated for Pro plugins if needed).
*   **Maintenance:** Recommended keeping a small periodic retainer for security updates (unlike Shopify, WP needs "care").
