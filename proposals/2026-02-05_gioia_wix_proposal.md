# [Gioia Cheese] Website Proposal: Wix Edition

**Executive Summary:**
A visually stunning, "design-first" website built on **Wix Studio**. This option sits between Shopify and WordPress—offering more creative freedom than Shopify's rigid themes, but with an easier drag-and-drop management interface than WordPress.

**Proposed Scope (Wix Studio):**

| Component | Est. Hours | Deliverables / Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Design & Interaction** | **12 hrs** | Leveraging Wix Studio's advanced animation capabilities to create a "Graza-like" immersive feel (parallax, scroll effects). |
| **💻 Dev & Build** | **20 hrs** | Drag-and-drop construction of 8 pages. <br>*Faster initial build than code, but requires manual tweaking for mobile breakpoints.* |
| **🛒 Store Setup** | **8 hrs** | Setting up Wix Stores product catalog (11 items), shipping rules, and payment connections. |

**Investment Breakdown:**
*   **Total Project Hours:** 40 hours
*   **Applied Rate:** $55 / hour (Partner Rate)
*   **Total Launch Investment:** **$2,200**

**Optional Add-on:**
*   **Basic SEO Setup:** +$770 (Keywords + Google Maps Setup).

**Ongoing Costs (Client Direct):**
*   **Wix Business Plan:** ~$25 - $35/month (Includes Hosting & Security).
*   **Domain:** ~$15/yr (if not already owned).
*   **Apps:** Minimal. Wix has many built-in features that Shopify requires apps for (e.g. loyalty, booking).

**Why choose this option?**
If the priority is **Visual Impact over E-commerce Power**, Wix allows us to push the design boundaries faster for a lower budget.
