# [Canggu Wellness Facility] Growth Proposal

## Executive Summary
For a new wellness facility in Canggu, the primary opportunity lies in capturing the high-intent "digital nomad" and "wellness tourist" market. These customers live on their phones and value seamless, high-end experiences.

Our strategy combines **Digital Dominance** (ensuring you appear first when they search for "recovery," "sauna," or "ice bath") with **Physical Engagement** (bridging the in-venue experience with your digital review ecosystem). By integrating NFC technology directly into the facility, we turn every visitor into a potential 5-star review and a repeat customer.

## Proposed Scope & Strategy

### 1. SEO Strategy: Local Authority (Tier 2)
The battle for "Wellness in Canggu" is won on Google Maps. Tourists search "near me" or "best sauna canggu."
*   **Map Pack Dominance:** Optimization of Google Business Profile with high-quality photos, Q&A seeding, and attribute optimization.
*   **Keyword Targeting:** Focus on "Ice Bath Canggu," "Recovery Center," "Sauna Bali" to capture high-intent traffic.
*   **Review Strategy:** Direct integration of physical NFC points to drive verified local reviews, signaling outcome relevance to Google.

### 2. Paid Media: High-Intent Capture (Tier 2)
We will split the budget between capturing *intent* (Google) and creating *desire* (Meta).
*   **Google Ads:** Bidding on "Bali Sauna" and competitor keywords to capture users actively looking for a session.
*   **Meta (IG/FB):** distinct "Lifestyle" ads targeting expats and tourists in the Seminyak/Canggu/Pererenan radius. showcasing the facility's aesthetic and social proof.

### 3. Infrastructure & Lead Routing (Tier 3)
Traffic is useless without conversion. We establish a seamless flow from "Click" to "Booked".
*   **Lead Capture:** Custom landing pages for ads to maximize conversion rates (avoiding generic homepage drop-offs).
*   **Routing:** integration with your booking engine.
*   **Automation:** Immediate WhatsApp/Email follow-up for abandoned bookings or inquiries.

### 4. Physical Product / NFC Strategy (Tier 4)
We deploy "Active" NFC points to drive engagement without friction.
*   **NFC Physical Stands:** Premium stands placed at reception and relaxation areas.
    *   **Function:** Tap to Review, Tap for Menu, or Tap to Join Membership.
    *   **Model:** fully managed rental service. We maintain the digital link, ensuring it always points to the most relevant destination (e.g., swapping "Review" for "Promo" during events).
