## Our Recommendation

**1. The "Graza" Match: Shopify ($2,530)**
This remains our **#1 Recommendation**. The checkout is the fastest in the world, and the mobile experience is unbeatable. It feels like a serious D2C brand.

**2. The "Budget + Visuals" Choice: Wix ($2,200)**
If you want to save slightly on budget and prioritize "cool animations" over "shopping capability", Wix is a strong contender. It is great for visual storytelling but has a slightly slower checkout flow.

**3. The "Long Term" Asset: WordPress ($3,080)**
Only choose this if you want 100% ownership and plan to build a massive media/content arm later.
